# OOP Lab Codes - BITS F213

Welcome to my repository of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab codes for the course **BITS F213** at **BITS Pilani, Dubai Campus**. This repository showcases various coding assignments and projects completed as part of the OOP course.

## üìö Overview

This repository includes all the codes I've written for the **OOP BITS F213** lab sessions. The code covers fundamental OOP principles such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Each lab assignment demonstrates practical implementations of these concepts using different programming challenges.

## üîç Contents

Here's a quick overview of the repository structure and the specific topics covered in each lab:

- **Lab1/**: Introduction to basic OOP concepts
  - **Topic**: Creating a simple bookstore management system in C
  - **Description**: This lab focuses on implementing basic OOP principles such as classes, objects, and encapsulation. The project involves designing a system to manage books, including functionalities for adding, removing, and displaying book details.

- **Lab2/**: Demonstration of inheritance and polymorphism
  - **Topic**: Implementing a library system with different types of media
  - **Description**: This lab explores inheritance and polymorphism by creating a library system that handles various types of media (e.g., books, magazines, DVDs). The assignment involves extending base classes to add specific features and using polymorphism to manage different media types uniformly.

- **Lab3/**: Advanced OOP concepts with practical examples
  - **Topic**: Designing a simplified banking system
  - **Description**: This lab delves into more advanced OOP concepts, including abstract classes and interfaces. The project involves building a banking system that supports different account types (e.g., savings, checking) and includes features like deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
