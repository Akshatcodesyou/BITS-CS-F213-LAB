# OOP Lab Codes - BITS F213

Welcome to my repository of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab codes for the course **BITS F213** at **BITS Pilani, Dubai Campus**. This repository showcases various coding assignments and projects completed as part of the OOP course.

## üìö Overview

This repository includes all the codes I've written for the **OOP BITS F213** lab sessions. The code covers fundamental OOP principles such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Each lab assignment demonstrates practical implementations of these concepts using different programming challenges.

## üîç Contents

Here's a quick overview of the repository structure:

- **Lab1/**: Introduction to basic OOP concepts
- **Lab2/**: Demonstration of inheritance and polymorphism
- **Lab3/**: Advanced OOP concepts with practical examples
