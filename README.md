# OOP Lab Codes - BITS F213

Welcome to my repository of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab codes for the course **BITS F213** at **BITS Pilani, Dubai Campus**. This repository showcases various coding assignments and projects completed as part of the OOP course.

## üìö Overview

This repository includes all the codes I've written for the **OOP BITS F213** lab sessions. The code covers fundamental OOP principles such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Each lab assignment demonstrates practical implementations of these concepts using different programming challenges.

## üîç Contents

Here's a quick overview of the repository structure and the specific topics covered in each lab:

- **Lab1/**: Introduction to basic OOP concepts with C
  - **Programs**: Bookstore.c

- **Lab2/**: Basic Math related codes
  - **Programs**: Circle.java, fivedigit.java, squarecube.java, zeropositivenegative.java

- **Lab3/**: Examples involving more objects and arrays
  - **Programs**: Element.java, Numberguessgame.java
